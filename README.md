# Metaballs
This project is a personal fun project coded in python, that creates a cool animated canvas composed of randomly places and randomly sized "metaballs".
When two such "metaballs" come close to each other, they start to fuse and create a bubble like effect.
The idea for this project came from "The Coding Train", from this video in particular: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccYLb7cLB1I.
The code requires the library "pygame" to be used, which can be installed through pip with the command "pip install pygame".
I do not intend on continuing this project any further, feel free to play around with it and have fun.
